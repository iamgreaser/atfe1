Here's some funk experiments I've been doing on stream.

## Usage

You'll need Python 3.

You'll also need the `play` command from SoX.

Run the following:

```
python3 funk1.py
```

## Initial conclusion

Funk is kinda easy to make. Well, at least the bassline.

Funk is the art of repeatedly doing almost the same thing each time.
